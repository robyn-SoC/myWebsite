            <h2>Aegean/Ionian Cruise</h2>
            <br/>
            <h3>27.09.18 to 07.10.18</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Back in September, we decided to cruise for the first time. This was a 7 night cruise with Tui with the following itinery:</p>
            <br/>    
            <ul>
                <li>Dubrovnik, Croatia</li>
                <li>Athens, Greece</li>
                <li>Corfu Town, Corfu</li>
                <li>Kotor, Montenegro</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>    
            <p>These places allowed us to see some incredible sights from the city walls of Dubrovnik to the rolling hills of the Kotor national parks. Although the weather left much to be desired - our stop in Crete was cancelled due to a freak cyclone - we had fun and adventure all the same!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The video featured is filmed on a GoPro and is a compilation of various activities we enjoyed whilst away. The video was edited using Adobe Premier Pro and is a 3 minute selection of several hours of footage.</p>

            <h4>Menorca - 01.05.15 to 04.05.15</h4>
            <p>A bank holiday trip to get some much needed sun and chill out time. The weather was good for the time of year and the resort was quiet, relaxing and pretty.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="holbox">
            <img src="images/hongkong2015.JPG" width="100%" style="border-bottom: 3px #FFF solid"/>
            <h4>Hong Kong - 11.11.15 to 17.11.15</h4>
            <p>I spent a week in Hong Kong on a business trip with TSL. This was for a charity event where people race for 24 hours in novelty pedal cars that they have built. </p>

        <div class="holbox">
            <img src="images/paris2015.jpg" width="100%" style="border-bottom: 3px #FFF solid"/>
            <h4>Paris - 13.12.15 to 16.12.15</h4>
            <p>This was purchased as a birthday surprise. We walked all day on the Monday to see Notre Dame, Louvre, Arc de Triomphe and The Eiffel Tower doing a total of nearly 13,000 steps!</p>

        <div class="holbox">
            <img src="images/tenerife2016.JPG" width="100%" style="border-bottom: 3px #FFF solid"/>
            <h4>Tenerife - 07.05.16 to 14.05.16</h4>
            <p>One of two "summer" holidays in 2016. The weather was very unpredictable occasionally leaving us disappointed but we managed to have an amazing day on the water slides at Siam Park before the rain arrived.</p>

        <div class="holbox firstofline">
            <img src="images/rhodes2016.JPG" width="100%" style="border-bottom: 3px #FFF solid"/>
            <h4>Rhodes - 10.09.16 - 17.09.16</h4>
            <p>A week of sun to help us recover from a short break at PortAventura the week prior. The hotel food was outstanding unlike the restaurant we ended up at where you BBQ your own food in 30 degree heat.</p>

        <div class="holbox">
            <img src="images/majorca2017.jpg" width="100%" style="border-bottom: 3px #FFF solid"/>
            <h4>Majorca - 04.06.17 to 11.06.17</h4>
            <p>Another week of sun for our main holiday of the year. This whole holiday was just about the relaxtion so not much was done. It would have been even better if the pool bar owned more than just a UB40 CD.</p>

        <div class="holbox">
            <img src="images/disney2018.jpg" width="100%" style="border-bottom: 3px #FFF solid"/>
            <h4>Disneyland Paris - 23.05.18 to 26.05.18</h4>
            <p>A classic break for myself and my best friend; the biggest Disnerds on the planet! The queue lines were fairly quiet, the weather was glorious and there were colletable pin badges aplenty!</p>

        <div class="holbox">
            <img src="images/lanzarote2018.JPG" width="100%" style="border-bottom: 3px #FFF solid"/>
            <h4>Lanzarote - 07.06.18 to 12.06.18</h4>
            <p>With a few days of annual leave to use up, we thought we would squeeze in a holiday. We were somewhat let down by the weather here again but that didn't stop us taking in some breathtaking landscapes at Timanfaya national park whilst riding some camels.</p>
